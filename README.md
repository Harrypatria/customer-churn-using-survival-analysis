### Customer churn using survival analysis

- Customer churn is a term used in the industry to describe when customers cease doing business with a company or stop using its services. 
- Survival analysis is a statistical method that can be used to analyze customer churn data, which involves estimating the probability of a customer continuing to use a service over time.


### Dataset
The dataset contains 3 tables of our interset:
- Members. Information about customers, such as gender, age, etc.
- Train. Churn label for each customer.
- Transactions. Historical transactions with dates, subscription plans, etc.

### The Tool: Survival Analysis
To do so, weâ€™re going to borrow a tool from an unlikely place, survival analysis. Survival analysis was first developed by actuaries and medical professionals to predict survival rates.
